Engine for the 3x3 grid card game.

## What is kyu?
Kyu is a card game played on a 3x3 grid. It is based on Triple Triad, a mini-game from Square Enix's Final Fantasy VIII. Two players draw a hand of 5 cards each. Each card has a number corresponding to each side of the card. Players then alternatively play cards in the grid. The numbers on each side of the card are compared against the opposing side of adjacent cards. If the played card's number exceeds the adjacent card's number, the adjacent card is "taken." The player with the most "owned" cards at the end of the round winds.

## How is kyu built?
Kyu is written in ECMAScript 6 and compiled to JavaScript (ECMAscript 5) using the 6to5 compiler.
